                <p> In today's digital age, the proliferation of phishing attacks poses a significant threat to online security and user privacy. To mitigate this risk, we present a web-based application designed to detect phishing websites using advanced machine learning techniques. The application leverages a modular framework built with Flask, ensuring robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture. Our solution employs a Gradient Boosting Classifier, trained on a comprehensive dataset of phishing and legitimate URLs, to accurately predict the likelihood of a given URL being malicious. The model incorporates various features extracted from URLs, including domain attributes, URL length, and presence of suspicious characters, to identify potential phishing attempts. The user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to easily input URLs and receive immediate feedback on their legitimacy. The application's backend seamlessly integrates data preprocessing, model inference, and result visualization, providing a streamlined experience for end-users.This web application serves as a proactive tool in the fight against phishing, offering individuals and organizations a reliable means to safeguard their online activities. By harnessing the power of machine learning, our solution not only enhances cybersecurity but also raises awareness about the dangers of phishing attacks. To mitigate this risk, we present a web-based application designed to detect phishing websites using advanced machine learning techniques. The application leverages a modular framework built with Flask, ensuring robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture. Malicious URL, a.k.a. malicious website, is a common and serious threat to cybersecurity. Malicious URLs host unsolicited content (spam, phishing, drive-by exploits, etc.) and lure unsuspecting users to become victims of scams (monetary loss, theft of private information, and malware installation), and cause losses of billions of dollars every year</p>
